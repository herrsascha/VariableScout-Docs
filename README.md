## Instructions

### Settings

| Setting | Description | How to Use | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Only selected Nodes | Displays data only for the nodes you have selected on the canvas. | Toggle this setting on to focus on currently selected elements. | If you select a button on your canvas, VariableScout will only show variables connected to that button. |
| Only Unused Variables | Shows variables that are not currently used in your documents page. | Enable this setting to identify and clean up unused variables. | Helps in finding color variables that are defined but not applied to any elements. |
| Focused View | Simplifies the display by showing only essential information like node labels. | Turn on to reduce visual clutter for easier navigation. | Hides detailed node paths, showing a streamlined list of node labels. |
| Copy Full Token | Copies the full token name, including its group structure, to your clipboard. | When enabled, copying a variable will include its full path. | Instead of copying just `primary-color`, it copies `colors/brand/primary-color`. |
| Merge Collection Sections | Merges variables and nodes into a single list, hiding individual collection and group sections. | Activate to view all cards in one continuous list. | Useful when you want a holistic view without the hierarchy of collections and groups. |
| Remember Settings | Saves your current settings for future sessions. | Toggle on to keep your preferences every time you use VariableScout. | If you always work with "Focused View" enabled, this setting ensures it's active on startup. |
